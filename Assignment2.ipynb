    "1. **Input Handling:**\n",
    "   - Write a `while` loop that:\n",
    "     - Continuously prompts the user to enter a number.\n",
    "     - Adds each entered number to a list called `numbers`.\n",
    "     - Stops when the user enters the word \"done\" (case-insensitive).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mean Calculation:**\n",
    "   - If the `numbers` list is not empty, calculate the mean of the numbers in the list.\n",
    "   - Print the mean using an f-string.\n",

    "   - Sort the `numbers` list in ascending order.\n",
    "   - Calculate the median.\n",
    "   - Print the median using an f-string.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Mode Calculation (Simple):**\n",
    "   - Calculate the mode (the most frequently occurring number).\n",
    "   - Print the mode using an f-string.\n",

    "6. **Standard Deviation Calculation:**\n",
    "   - Calculate the standard deviation of the numbers in the list.\n",
    "   - Print the standard deviation using an f-string.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Range Calculation:**\n",
    "   - Calculate the range.\n",
    "   - Print the range using an f-string.\n",

    "8. **IQR Calculation:**\n",
